# Bikesharing

## Project Overview 
After a trip to New York City, the clients want to institute a bike sharing business in their hometown of Des Moines, Iowa modeled after the Citi Bike in NYC. At the request of key stakeholders a bike trip analysis was compiled addressing their main questions; which examines the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 
Additional analysis was done to answer general business viability and risk management questions such as usage for loyalty members, top starting and ending locations, and bikes that are in need of repairs.
